## Environment Setup

### Required Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

\`\`\`env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key_here
\`\`\`

### Getting a Gemini API Key

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy the generated key (starts with "AIzaSy")
5. Add it to your `.env.local` file

## Security

- ‚úÖ **API keys are stored server-side only** - Never exposed to client
- ‚úÖ **Environment variables are gitignored** - Safe for public repositories
- ‚úÖ **Secure error handling** - No sensitive information leaked in errors
- ‚úÖ **Server-side AI processing** - All API calls happen on the backend
